Hearty, satisfying, and warming, this lamb and vegetable stew is prepared in a single large pot. First, you’ll cut the lamb steaks into small pieces and brown the meat, then transfer it to a plate. Next, you’ll cook the carrots and onion, before adding a tablespoon of flour, which helps to thicken the brothy stew as it cooks. Simmer the remaining ingredients for about 10 minutes more, stir it all together, and you’re done. Since our recipe boasts carrots, green beans, and tomatoes, you won’t feel guilty about this all-in-one meal. On a chilly night, it’s the ideal simple supper.

### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons olive oil 
* 1.5 pounds lamb steaks (top round or shoulder), bones removed and meat cut into 2-inch pieces 
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper 
* 4 carrots
* 1 onion, sliced 
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
* .5 cup dry white wine 
* 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 
* 1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained 
* 4 ounces green beans, cut into small pieces (about 1 cup) 
* 1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped

### Method
1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season the lamb with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, until medium-rare, 6 to 8 minutes; transfer to a plate.
2. Add the carrots cut into 3-inch sticks, onion, and the remaining oil to the pot. Cook until beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and scrape up any brown bits.
3. Add the broth, tomatoes, and beans. Simmer until the vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the lamb, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Serve immediately.
4. To freeze: Cool the stew to room temperature and spoon into a freezer container or bag. Freeze for up to 3 months. To cook, thaw the stew in a bowl of cold water or overnight in the refrigerator. Transfer to a pot and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 10 to 20 minutes.
