tags: veggie, dinner, soup

> **Servings:** 6

### Ingredients

* 3 tbsp unsalted butter
* 2 cups roughly chopped yellow onions
* 2 pounds pre-cut butternut squash
* 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks (about 1-1/2 pounds before peeling)
* 8 cups chicken broth
* 1-1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tart yet sweet apple, such as Fuji or Honeycrisp, cored, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 3 tbsp honey
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground mace
* 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 cup heavy cream

### Method

1. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large pot. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the butternut squash, sweet potatoes, chicken broth, salt, and pepper to the pot. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low; simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat.
3. Add the diced apple and honey and purée the soup with a handheld immersion blender until very smooth and creamy. (Alternatively, use a standard blender to purée soup in batches, being careful not to fill the jar more than halfway. Leave the hole in the lid open and loosely cover with a dish towel to allow the heat to escape. Pour the blended soup into a clean pot.)
4. Stir in the cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer, then taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. To thicken the soup, simmer over low heat until desired consistency is reached.
