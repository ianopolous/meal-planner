tags: haddock,fish,dinner

> **Servings:** 3

### Ingredients
* small knob of butter
* 1 large leek, thinly sliced
* 300g risotto rice, such as arborio or carnaroli
* 700ml fish or vegetable stock
* packet of peas
* 250ml full-fat milk
* 375g undyed smoked haddock, skinned and cut into large chunks
* 3 tbsp greek yoghurt
* 100g baby spinach

### Method
1. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat the butter in a large ovenproof dish over a medium heat. Cook the leek for 4-5 mins, stirring regularly, until just tender. Add the rice and stir for a further 2 mins.
2. Add the stock and milk, bring to the boil and bubble for 5 mins before sitting the haddock on top. Cover with a lid or foil and bake in the oven for 20-25 mins until the rice is tender.
3. Fold in the yoghurt and spinach, season with plenty of black pepper, then cover the pan again and leave to rest out of the oven for 3 mins before serving â€“ the steam will soften the spinach.
