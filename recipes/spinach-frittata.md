### Ingredients

* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 400g new potatoes, roughly chopped
* 1 large red onion, finely chopped
* 8 large free-range eggs
* 100ml single cream
* 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
* handful mint leaves, finely chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, sliced
* 150g spinach, roughly chopped
* 120g goats' cheese, roughly chopped
* 12 sage leaves
* 1 tsp salt
* 1tsp freshly ground black pepper

### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof frying pan over a medium-low heat. Add the potatoes with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring for 8–10 minutes. Toss in the red onion and cook for a further 5 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a large bowl. Add the cream, nutmeg, chopped mint and some salt and pepper and whisk well. Set aside.

3. Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, then toss in the spinach and sauté until it begins to wilt. Pour the cream mixture into the pan, stir around for one minute, then remove from the heat.

4. Dot the goats’ cheese evenly over the surface of the frittata and scatter over the sage leaves. Place on the top shelf of the oven for 8–10 minutes, or until the egg has set and the cheese is golden.

5. Remove the frittata from the oven and leave to stand for a few minutes to cool slightly before serving.
